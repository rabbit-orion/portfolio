# Spatiotemporal Analysis of Lyme Disease
This portfolio piece is a final project I completed for the course "Spatial-Temporal Dynamics Using GIS". Using the [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution), I calculated a space-time scan of Lyme disease incidence rates in New Jersey counties using data from the CDC, observing high clustering around Warren County and low clustering around Essex County.

To complete this project, I performed a literature review on spatiotemporal analysis of Lyme disease, designed a methodology to calculate a space-time scan statistic using a Poisson probability model, and implemented the clustering analysis using [SaTScan](https://www.satscan.org/), a public health and epidemiology tool used for space-time analysis. Supplemental data processing was performed using Excel and ArcMap (ArcGIS Desktop). I wrote my report using Word and created maps using ArcMap. The full report is available [here](). Maps and conceptual and workflow diagrams can be seen below.
