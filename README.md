# Portfolio
This repo contains my portfolio projects.
##
* [Spatial Overlap of Polygons](polygon-spatial-overlap): Designed a PyQGIS-based processing script that calculates the spatial overlap of two polygon datasets, measured using the [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). Used to compare area changes in ZIP Code Tabulation Areas between 2010 and 2020.
* [Spatial Autocorrelation of Cross-Gender Friending Ratios](https://github.com/rabbit-orion/portfolio/tree/main/cgfr-localmoransi): Designed a Python-based processing script that calculates global and local spatial autocorrelation of [cross-gender friending ratios (CGFRs)](https://drew-johnston.com/files/cross_gender_ties/Cross-Gender_Social_Ties_Around_the_World.pdf) using the [Moran's I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran%27s_I) statistic. Used to analyze spatial clustering of CGFRs in Germany at the district level.
