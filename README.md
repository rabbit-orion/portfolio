* [Spatial Overlap of Polygons](polygon-spatial-overlap): Designed a PyQGIS-based processing script that calculates the spatial overlap of two polygon datasets, measured using the [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). Used to compare area changes in ZIP Code Tabulation Areas between 2010 and 2020.
